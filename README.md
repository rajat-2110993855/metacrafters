Description
The code represents a Solidity smart contract named Exception that showcases exception handling using require(), assert(), and revert() statements. Overall The main objective of this smart contract is to demonstrate different ways of handling exceptions and errors in Solidity. It includes three functions:

Code Explanation
The contract begins with a special comment, // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT, which specifies the MIT license under which the code is distributed. This indicates that the code can be used, modified, and distributed under the terms of the MIT license. The next line of code, pragma solidity 0.8.18;, specifies the version of the Solidity programming language used in the contract. In this case, the contract is written using Solidity version 0.8.18. The contract itself is named Exception. This Solidity smart contract is named Exception, and it demonstrates the usage of different exception-handling mechanisms: require(), assert(), and revert(). so let's go deeper into it. The contract has a state variable named value, which is declared as uint256 public. State variables are stored on the blockchain and maintain their values across different function calls and transactions. The setValue function: This function allows the contract owner to set a new value in the value state variable. However, there's a condition using require() that checks whether the new value is greater than the current value. If the condition is not met, the transaction will be reverted, and the specified error message ("New value must be greater than the current value.") will be returned.

The getSquare function: This function takes an input number as an argument and returns its square. Before performing the calculation, the function uses assert() to check an invariant condition that the input number should be non-negative (greater than or equal to 0). If the condition is false, indicating a bug in the code, the transaction will be reverted. The always revert function: This function demonstrates how to explicitly revert a transaction using revert(). It simply reverts the transaction with a custom error message ("This function always reverts.") whenever it is called.

These exception-handling mechanisms are crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of smart contracts. They allow developers to enforce certain conditions and handle exceptional situations effectively, ensuring the desired behavior and preventing undesired states in the contract.

## Help

Make sure to have the compiler option set to 0.8.18 to avoid version depenedency errors. 
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.18
```
